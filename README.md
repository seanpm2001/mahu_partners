# TYPO3 extension `mahu_partners`

The extension `mahu_partners` offers the domain model for companies / institutes and regulations used in the [Material Hub](https://www.materialhub.de). In addition, it provides listings, search functionality and detail pages for both entities. 

Furthermore, the extension comes with a frontend editor for company / institute records. In this regard, each Company record is associated with the user that created it. A listing of the records created by the currently logged in user is a further feature of this extension.

In addition there is a simple file management per Company record. To this end, the extension offers a listing of files in the directory associated with the Company and allows to upload new files, respectively, delete existing ones.

## Development

All Material Hub extension are shipped with a [grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) configuration \(requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)\). This ensures that during development the files from /Resources/Private/Css and /Resources/Private/JavaScript are copied to /Resources/Public as soon as changes occur. For this purpose, the command `grunt` must be executed in the root directory of the respective project via the console. Before committing to git, it is recommended to automatically generate a "production version" with the command `grunt buildProd`, where minified files are stored in the /Resources/Public folder.

Default settings and example:

		menu {
			0 = 5
			1 = 10
			2 = 20
			3 = 50
			4 = 100
		}
	}
```

### Sorting

Result sorting (relevant for the plugin modes "Partner" and "Regulations") can be influenced using the arrays `sort` and `sortOptions`.

- `sort`: An array with items of the following structure:
    - `id`: the ID of that sort option
    - `sortCriteria`: the actual sort configuration consisting of a property name and the sort order (either "asc" or "desc")
- `sortOptions`: UI-related settings
    - `menu`: an array that defines the sort options (see `sort`) to appear in a drop down list in the search UI
    - `selected`: Defines the sort option that is initially selected in the drop down list

Default settings and example:

```
	sort {
		0 {
			id = nameAsc
			sortCriteria = name asc
		}
		1 {
			id = nameDesc
			sortCriteria = name desc
		}
	}
	sortOptions {
		menu {
			0 = nameAsc
			1 = nameDesc
		}
		selected = nameAsc
	}
```


### E-mail notifications

    - `senderName`: the name of the sender
    - `to` (e-mail address): the e-mail address of the receiver
    - `toName`: the name of the receiver

	notification {
		add {
			enabled = 1
			sender = sender@example.org
			senderName = Sender
			to = receiver@example.com
			toName = Receiver
		}
		edit {
			enabled = 1
			sender = sender@example.org
			senderName = Sender
			to = receiver@example.com
			toName = Receiver
		}
	}
```
